## about 
Solving problems with code
Software development student

My name is Kendra, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
 Before I decided to change careers, I was deeply immersed in the world 
of Human Resources, making meaningful contributions to the workforce. 
However, something inside me was yearning for a new challenge, and 
that's when I discovered my passion for coding.

The decision to learn Software Development was a natural one for me. 
Coding brings me immense joy, and I believe it holds the power to 
transform ideas into reality. I knew that by pursuing this path, I could
 combine my problem-solving skills with the magic of technology to 
create innovative solutions.

What makes this specific skill so appealing to me is the boundless 
potential it offers. I find fulfillment in streamlining workflows and 
optimizing processes, and coding is the key to achieving that. It opens 
up a world of endless possibilities and empowers me to build software 
that can make a positive impact.

As I embark on this new chapter, I am eagerly seeking an ideal 
environment where I can put my newfound skills to work in a professional
 setting. I am ready to collaborate with like-minded individuals and 
contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.

My previous experiences in HR have given me a unique perspective, 
allowing me to understand the importance of efficient systems and 
user-friendly interfaces. I am excited to leverage this background to 
add value to my new career in tech.
